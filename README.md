IntervalMonitor.py: a script to determine if the current time is between a set interval, say, between 11pm one day and 2am the next. Created this script when I was playing around with a motion sensing routine for my raspberry pi that I found on the net, by brainflakes. I wanted to set up the script to only work between set hours and I didn't find any self-contained way of doing this.
